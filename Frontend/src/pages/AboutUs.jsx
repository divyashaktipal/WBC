              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2020, Woman Business Circle began as a small group of women entrepreneurs who recognized 
                the need for a dedicated space where women could support each other in their business endeavors.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as informal coffee meetings has grown into a thriving community of over 500 women 
                entrepreneurs across various industries. We've helped launch hundreds of businesses, facilitated 
                countless partnerships, and created a network that spans the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue to grow and evolve, always staying true to our founding principle: 
                "We Create Opportunity, We Build Success, We Grow Together."
